[Mac Addresses on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)

## Warnings

Mac Addresses should not be used in situations where anonimity is desired as they can be traced across multiple sessions / locations / etc and, potentially, be used to track / identify the user.

Also, many devices can spoof, generate and/or randomize their Mac Address.
